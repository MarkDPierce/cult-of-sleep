# Signing Up for a Discord Event

## Setup Guildsofwow.com Integrations
TODO: Write this section, its a pain, I need to deauth my integrations first before doing this and "not right now" is my excuse.

## Signing up for a new Event

Depending on the event type, the event could be posted in #events or #-raid-signup. Just check which channels you have access too and which events you want to attend as this guide should cover any channels posted even.

For the sake of this walk-through I'll be signing up for a raid on my main

1) Find your event

This looks fun! I think I'll sign up to be a healer for this event.

2) Set your attendance by clicking the "Set Attendance" box. This will create a chat reply in the same channel the event is posted in. Only you can see this message.

3) Select your attendance, character and spec in the new chat dialog

Since there is a connection between Discord, Battle.net and Guildsofwow.com this chat box will be populated with your character details. Once you have finished selecting everything, you can click save.

4) After clicking save, two things will have happened. First, the event will be updated with your attendance.

Second, the channel the event is posted in should have a new message with your characters attendance details. Be aware that after a while, this message will go away and if you would like to adjust your attendance or change characters you will have to follow the next process for updating character specific information for an event.

# Removing yourself from a Raid

When you sign up for an event the last message you will receive is the character attendance message that lets you update the status or set notes. However, after a certain amount of time, this message gets purged from the events channel and you will have to go through the following to update attendance or change characters.

1) If the Character Attendance message is gone. You can generate it again by selecting the event you have already "Set Attendance" for. Just click "Set Attendance" again. This time, the signup message will have "New Attendance" or "Character-name * Attending"

2) Just like the initial event signup message, you can modify you attendance now.

3) The tool still requires you to select a spec

4) Click "Save" to set your new attendance.

5) **OPTIONAL** If you are swapping characters, you will have to repeat the above steps 1-4 for that new character.
